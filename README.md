# collatz_analysis
The purpose of this repository is to analyze and visualize patterns within the collatz conjecture, a mathematical conjecture that has never been proven.

Research Questions:
1. what causes repeating '4, 2, 1' leading digit and how frequently does this pattern occur.
2. Are there any patterns in terms of input numbers(x) grouped by iteration #.
